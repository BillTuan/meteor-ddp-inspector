## DDP Inspector

This is a __client-side__ DDP inspector that will capture all DDP activity. You've heard the phrase "data over the wire", but have you seen what that data looks like? This will show you. __This package will not be compiled into production__.

## Installation

```
meteor add lai:ddp-inspector
```

## Usage

Press (Ctrl/Cmd) + D to toggle panel on the left.
Search for any DDP message (uses regex searching of a local collection).

## More Info

#### Limiting Result Set
The panel will only show you 50 DDP messages at a time, the most recent ones first. If you want to see more DDP messages, simply call `Session.setPersistent('lai:ddp-inspector.limit', YouDesiredNumber);`.

#### Search Term Persistence
If you reload, your search will remain in the search box. However, your DDP messages will be gone.

#### Console Log
By default, the DDP messages are not logged to the console, if you still would like to see them in the console, simply call `Session.setPersistent('lai:ddp-inspector.console', true)`.

#### Legacy Version
If you want the old school version that only outputs to the console, `meteor add lai:ddp-inspector@0.6.0`.

#### Resetting
The Reset button is there to clear the local collection of DDP messages in case it gets too big. Clearing it will speed up the search. I am still trying to figure out how to optimize the performance.

#### Integration With Constellation Console
If you install `constellation:console`, the DDP panel will plug right into it as a new tab. Thanks @JackAdams for this!

## Future

* [x] Persistent active/inactive state through manual reloads (it already keep state in hot code reloads).
* [x] Full text search the DDP messages
* [x] UI Panel
* [x] Hot key toggle
* [x] Throttle re-rendering to improve performance of panel
* [ ] Use tokens to have more granular search
* [ ] Limit changing ability
* [ ] Possible use of Clusterize.js to show huge amounts of DDP messages with no performance implications
